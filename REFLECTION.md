Reflection:

* Were my predictions right?
Screen Time: I predicted Wednesday would have the highest screen time, which was correct.
Focus Day: I thought Thursday would be my best focus day, which was also correct.
Average Sleep: I was close with my prediction but I got 7.1 instead of 7.75 hours.
Most Frequent Mood: I predicted my most frequent mood would be "happy," but it was actually "productive."
Caffeine and Focus: I thought caffeine would improve my focus but it did not.

* What surprised me?
I was surprised to see that my average sleep was only 7.1 hours. I thought I was getting closer to 8 hours.

* What was tricky or rewarding?
The trickiest part was writing the mood frequency function to make sure it correctly counted each mood.

* How did using my own data change things?
Using my own data made the analysis more personal and fun as opposed to using a random data set.
